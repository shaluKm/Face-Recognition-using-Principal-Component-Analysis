# Face-Recognition-using-Principal-Component-Analysis
Developed a PCA-based face recognition system using Eigenfaces to reduce dimensionality and highlight key facial features. By projecting face images onto a space defined by principal components, the model captures essential facial variations, enabling efficient and accurate face classification and recognition.
